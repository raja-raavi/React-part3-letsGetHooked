There are 2 ways to export the data

1. export default <name>
1. import <component> from "path"

1. named export - In single file we have to export multiple files
   export CONST_URL = "https./jnascaobobaobacb"
1. export {CONST_URL} form "path"

H/W - can I use default export along with named export?

Yes - we can use the combination of both

State is a super powerFul variable in React.. How do you make it super powerful.. to do that we use hooks i.e useState
Definition : Whenever the state variables updates, React renders the component
Functional component at the end of the day is normal JS fn
Recat.createElement at the end of the day is a normal JS object
||y Hook are normal JS functions the onlly difference is, it comes it super powers

- useState() - superPowerful state variables in react
- useEffect()

Virtual DOM - it's a representation of Actula DOM and it's like a normal JS object
